/**
 * "Hey Jarvis" from the ignition screen.
 *
 * Mirrors clap.ts: a second way in, alongside the button and the clap, live
 * only while the ignition screen is showing. Uses the browser's own
 * SpeechRecognition directly rather than going through startVoice/vad — that
 * pair assumes the app is already booted (mode(), phase-aware handlers), and
 * pulling it in here for one regex test would be the tail wagging the dog.
 *
 * Deliberately silent about failure, same reasoning as clap.ts: this is an
 * alternative to the button, not a requirement, so a browser with no
 * SpeechRecognition (or a refused microphone) should quietly do without it
 * rather than report an error about a feature nobody asked for.
