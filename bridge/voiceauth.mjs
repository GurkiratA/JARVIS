/**
 * Voice authentication — JARVIS only acts on speech from an enrolled voice.
 *
 * Runs entirely on this machine via an open speaker-embedding model
 * (speaker-model.mjs) — no account, no API key, nothing sent anywhere. Two
 * halves:
 *
 *   - Enrollment (this file's tools): a person talks for ~20 seconds, an
 *     embedding is computed for each few-second window and averaged into one
 *     profile, saved to disk under a name.
 *   - Verification (verifySpeaker, called from server.mjs's /stt handler,
 *     not from here): every utterance's embedding is compared against every
 *     saved profile BEFORE it ever reaches the model. A voice that doesn't
 *     match anyone enrolled is dropped right there — silently, the same way
 *     the existing /stt handler already drops silence, so JARVIS simply
 *     never responds to it rather than calling out an unrecognized speaker.
 *
 * The feature is off by default and stays off until someone is enrolled: no
 * profiles on disk means verifySpeaker() waves every utterance through
 * unchanged, so a machine that never sets this up behaves exactly as it did
 * before this file existed.
 *
 * Authorizing a SECOND voice is deliberately not self-service. By the time
 * the model can call enroll_voice at all, the speaker who asked for it has
 * already passed verification (or no profile exists yet, meaning this is the
 * very first enrollment) — an unenrolled person's own speech never reaches
 * the model to ask for themselves. The system prompt is what actually asks
 * "do you want to authorize someone else's voice?" before a second profile
 * is created; that is a conversational courtesy this file doesn't enforce
 * mechanically, because the gate above already makes it safe either way.

 * The model author's own general-purpose recommendation is 0.5. This runs

 * reject just means asking someone to talk again. Confirmed live that 0.5
 * let a parent and child through as the same profile — related voices are a
 * known hard case (vocal tract shape is partly heritable), so this errs
 * conservative rather than trusting the general-purpose default.

Ask for about 20 seconds of them talking normally — reading a sentence, describing
their day, anything continuous. This works for enrolling yourself for the first
time, and for adding anyone else afterwards.

IMPORTANT: once at least one voice is enrolled, JARVIS will ONLY respond to
enrolled voices — anyone else's speech is silently ignored before it ever
reaches you. So:
  - The very first enrollment ever (no one enrolled yet) needs no confirmation
    — it's the owner setting this up, do it directly when asked.
  - Enrolling a SECOND or later voice is a real decision — the owner is about
    to let someone else's speech control JARVIS. Confirm with them first
    ("do you want to give voice access to someone else?") before calling
    this, unless they already made the request explicit and specific
    (named the person and asked to add them).

Returns whether it worked. On the very first call ever, the model itself is
downloaded first (a few seconds) — that's normal, not an error.`
