/**
 * The screen, captured directly by this process — not the browser.
 *
 * getDisplayMedia() (what the browser would otherwise use) cannot be made to
 * skip Chrome's "Choose what to share" picker. That is deliberate, permanent
 * browser policy, not a setting or a flag: silently granting a page a live
 * feed of the whole screen is the exact thing the picker exists to prevent,
 * so there is no API that waives it. Asked for a screenshot with no click,
 * the only honest fix is to stop asking the browser at all.
 *
 * This process is not a web page — it is a local Node program the user
 * started themselves, with the same standing on this machine as any other
 * app they run, so it can talk to the desktop directly. It does that through
 * ffmpeg's gdigrab input (a Windows screen-capture device), run as a child
 * process rather than through some screenshot library, because the exact
 * same tool and the exact same code path serve both a single frame and a
 * whole recording — a screenshot is just `-frames:v 1`.
 *
 * Windows quietly moves Pictures/Videos under OneDrive when Known Folder
 * Move is on, so — same fix as resolveFolder() in files.mjs — files are
 * saved into whichever of the two actually exists, defaulting to the plain
 * one.
