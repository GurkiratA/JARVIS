/**
 * General web search, via Parallel (parallel.ai).
 *
 * This is the piece the rest of the prompt has been assuming existed since
 * before any of the tools in this file were written: panels.mjs's DESIGN_SYSTEM
 * has always told the model to "fetch with exa" for anything from the web —
 * but no exa MCP server has ever actually been configured on this machine, so
 * that instruction pointed at nothing. Not a regression; it was always this
 * way, just never diagnosed until now. This tool is what that instruction
 * needed to be about.
 *
 * Returns ranked pages — url, title, a text excerpt — not images. For a
 * picture, use image_search or web_image_search (images.mjs) instead; this is
 * for "what does X say", "what's the latest on Y", ordinary research.

Use this for anything that needs real content from the web: "what's the latest
on X", "what does the Y documentation say", a fact you don't already know, a
question about something recent. This is general research, not an image
search — for a picture, use image_search or web_image_search instead.

Returns a ranked list of pages: url, title, and a text excerpt of the
relevant part. Read the excerpts and answer from them directly — do not just
list URLs, and never speak a URL aloud (see the system prompt's rule on that).
If you need the page's full text rather than an excerpt, \`probe_url\` and a
blade (kind "article") can fetch and show it properly.`
